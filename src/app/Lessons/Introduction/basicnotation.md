<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>When written on a staff, a note indicates a pitch and rhythmic value. The notation consists of a *notehead* (either empty or filled in), and optionally can include a *stem*, *beam*, *dot*, or *flag*. </p>

<h3>Staff</h3>

<p>Notes can't convey their pitch information without being placed on a staff. A staff consists of five horizontal lines, evenly spaced. The plural of staff is *staves*.</p>

<h3>Clefs</h3>

<p>Notes *still* can't convey their pitch information if the staff doesn't include a clef. A clef indicates which pitches are assigned to the lines and spaces on a staff. The two most commonly used clefs are the *treble* and *bass* clef; others that you'll see relatively frequently are *alto* and *tenor* clef. </p>

<p>ere is the pitch C4 placed on the treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs.</p>

<h3>Grand staff</h3>

<p>The grand staff consists of two staves, one that uses a treble clef, and one that uses a bass clef. The staves are connected by a curly brace. Grand staves are used frequently for notating piano music and other polyphonic instruments. </p>

<h3>Ledger lines</h3>

<p>When the music's range exceeds what can be written on the staff, extra lines are drawn so that we can still clearly read the pitch. These extra lines are called *ledger lines.* In the example below, From Haydn's Piano Sonata in G (Hob. XVI: 39), Ab5 occurs just above the treble staff in the right hand, and G3 and B3 occur just below the treble staff in the left hand.</p>

<h3>Accidentals</h3>

<p>Accidentals are used to indicate when a pitch has been raised or lowered. They are written to the *left* of the pitch. </p>

<p>- When you lower one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a flat. </p>
<p>- When you raise one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a sharp.</p>
<p>- When you raise a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a natural.</p>
<p>- When you lower a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a double flat. </p>
<p>- When you raise a note that is already sharp by a semitone, you add a double sharp.</p>

<p>The example below shows the symbols for flat, natural, sharp, double sharp, and double flat, respectively</p>
